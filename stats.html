                 <p>Out of 195 counties, <a class="hyperlink" title="countries with universal health care" target=”_blank” href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-universal-healthcare">117</a> have universal healthcare in 2020. According to <a class="hyperlink" title="Visit debt.org" target=”_blank” href="https://www.debt.org/medical/#:~:text=Medical%20Bill%20Debt%20%26%20Costs,than%20consumers%20in%20other%20countries.">debt.org</a>, the average daily hospital cost is $5,220. The average U.S. consumer spends more than $10,000 a year on healthcare. That's 50% more than consumers in other countries. A recent <a class="hyperlink" atl="Commonwealth Survey" target=”_blank” href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/survey-79-million-americans-have-problems-medical-bills-or-debt">survey</a> from The Commonwealth Fund finds that 72 million Americans are struggling to pay their medical bills and have accumulated medical debt over time.</p>
                 
                 <p>Unfortunately, the United States is still deeply polarized on this topic with 85% of Democratic voters who think it’s the government’s responsibility to ensure everybody has health coverage, but only 27 percent of Republicans agree. Overall, including independents, 57 percent of Americans say the government has this obligation.</p>

                 <p> In other countries, there might be disagreement about how to achieve universal health care, but both ends of the political spectrum start from the same premise: Everybody should be covered. Of course, every system for universal health care comes with trade-offs that should be taken into serious consideration. For example, in Australia wait time in hospitals are longer in public hospitals than in private ones.</p>

                 <p>Universal health care requires a lot of government spending and regulation and there is no way to avoid it. But even in the Netherlands, which relies on private health insurers, the government oversees everything. It sets rules about what benefits have to be covered, what prices can be charged, and what cost sharing is required. It collects contributions from employers to pay the cost of covering everybody and spreads it among the insurers based on the health status of their customers. All told, about 75 percent of the funding for health insurance in the Netherlands is still running through the national government, even if the actual insurance benefits are being administered by private companies. The US stands alone in how much more of its health spending comes from private sources — and still doesn’t have universal coverage.
                 </p>

                 <p>There are stricter controls on healthcare cost in other contries compared to the U.S. As research shows, the US spends dramatically more for many common medical services compared to other developed countries. </p>

                <p>Health care in the US varies by geography, of course, depending on which state you live in. It also varies by age: The US does quite well with the over-65 population (which is covered by one public program, Medicare) but struggles with the under-65 patients (covered by private and public insurers) compared to other countries. Racial disparities run deep too: There is effectively one health system for white people and another for minorities, given the disparities in income.

             <h3>Every health system is different. But all of them, except ours, have figured out a way to make being uninsured or going bankrupt over medical bills a thing of the past. The US can do better.</h3>
